# Overview
I am Zhuoran Wei, a master student at the institute of parallel and distributed systems (IPADS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
Currently I am working on application of formal verification in database systems under the supervision of [Prof. Zhaoguo Wang](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/pub/members/zhaoguo_wang).

# Projects

## SQLSolver
[Github repo](https://github.com/SJTU-IPADS/SQLSolver)
SQLSolver is an automated prover for the equivalence of SQL queries.
I contributed to the implementation and refactor of SQLSolver.

## SQLRuleGen
SQLRuleGen automatically extracts rewrite rules from equivalent SQL queries.
I implemented this tool.

## AtomFS
AtomFS is a formally-verified concurrent file system with fine-grained locking.
